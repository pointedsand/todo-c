# 📝 To-do List CLI
A minimalist to-do list app built in C using `ncurses` providing a terminal UI experience.

## Features

- 📋 Create, view, and switch between multiple task lists
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete (or undo your impulsive victories)
- ➕ Add new tasks in seconds
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 💾 Coming soon: persistent file I/O, because your memory isn't good enough
- 🔌 Future plans include HTTP backend integration... because why not 

## Why?

Because it's a canon event for every developer to make at least one to-do app, and I wanted mine in the terminal—built in the greatest language known to man: raw C. Consider this my declaration of war against bloated productivity software :)

## Controls

Type shown commands directly into the interface:
* `[addtask]`
* `[deletetask]`
* `[createlist]`
* `[switchlist]`
* `[complete]`
* `[quit]`
